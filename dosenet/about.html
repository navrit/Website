                    Educated and science and technology-literate citizens and decision makers provide the backbone needed for communities to thrive. Understanding fundamental science and engineering concepts is a prerequisite for processing information effectively and making sound decisions based on relevant data.

                    DoseNet aims to form a network with schools throughout the Bay Area and beyond that will serve as to establish a relationship between UC Berkeley and member high schools. We see interacting with young students in this way as vital to improving community understanding of radiation and radiation risks as well as providing valuable hands-on experimentation in a relevant and cutting edge scientific endeavor. To aid in building this community, we plan to have semi-yearly workshops, bringing together students from across the network to present the results from measurements taken at their location and absorb new concepts from their scientific community.
